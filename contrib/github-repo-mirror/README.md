# Mirroring the Class GitHub Repository

Many of the assignments for this class are hosted in a GitHub repository.
Individual assignments are in subfolders of that repository.  Within the folder
for every assignment is a `README.md` file, containing the description for the
assignment.  The folder also contains other files that are part of the
assignment.  The description of the assignment is often best viewed on the
GitHub site itself with a Web browser.  The accompanying files can be
downloaded directly from the folder, with a Web browser. However, creating a
_mirror_ of the repository helps you to more easily download files associated
with assignments, keep them up-to-date, and simultaneously version your own
code by committing it to your own private GitHub repository.

The path of the class "upstream" repository and the name of own "private"
repository will be given to you elsewhere and will be referred to in this
document as "CLASS\_REPO\_PATH" and "PRIVATE\_REPO\_NAME", respectively.
Additionally, "USERNAME" refers to your GitHub username.

These instructions have first you create your mirrored repository _on a CS lab
machine_ and optionally create clones of that repository on other machines
(e.g., a laptop).


# Preparation

Either log on to a BYU CS lab workstation directly or log on remotely via SSH
using the following command:

```
ssh username@schizo.cs.byu.edu
```
(Replace "username" with your actual CS username)


# Register an SSH Key for Use with GitHub

These steps are necessary for you to use SSH to fetch and push your updates
from and to GitHub.  They should be performed on the machine on which you will
be doing your work.  If you already have an SSH key registered with GitHub from
the machine on which you will be doing your work, then you do not need to do
this again.

 1. Find out if you already have an SSH key to use by running the following:

    ```bash
    $ ls -ltra ~/.ssh/id_*
    -rw-r--r-- 1 user group  564 Jan  7 15:35 /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    -rw------- 1 user group 2635 Jan  7 15:35 /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

    In the above example, there is a public/private key pair named `id_rsa.pub`
    and `id_rsa`, respectively.  However, if there are no keys, `ls` will
    return an error:

    ```bash
    $ ls -ltra ~/.ssh/id_*
    ls: cannot access '/home/user/.ssh/id_*': No such file or directory
    ```

    If you have keys then you can now to step 3.  Otherwise, continue to step 2.

 2. Run the following from the command line to create an SSH public/private key
    pair:

    ```bash
    $ ssh-keygen
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    ```

    At the following prompt, just hit enter to use the default file location:

    ```
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
    ```

    Optionally enter a passphrase at the next prompt.  This makes sure that the
    private key cannot be used without the passphrase. This is good practice
    for a shared machine in particular:

    ```
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    ```

 3. Print the contents of your _public_ key, and copy them to your clipboard:

    ```bash
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

    (this assumes the name of your public key file is `id_rsa.pub`.)

 4. Follow steps 2 through 8 in the
    [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
    to register your SSH key with your GitHub account.


# Create a Mirrored Version of the Class Repository

This is a one-time process to create and configure your own private GitHub
repository for referencing and committing changes.  Your private repository
will also be a mirror of the upstream class repository.

 1. Create the private repository as a new repository on GitHub. Follow steps 1
    through 6 in the
    [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo#create-a-repository),
    adhering to the following:

    - Create the repository under your GitHub user ("USERNAME"), and name the
      repository according to PRIVATE\_REPO\_NAME (Step 2).
    - Make sure the visibility of the repository is _Private_ (Step 4).
    - Do _not_ check the box "Initialize this repository with a README" (Step 5).

 2. Please double-check that your repository is _private_.

 3. Clone the upstream repository by running the following from the
    terminal:

    ```bash
    $ git clone --bare https://github.com/CLASS_REPO_PATH upstream-repo
    ```

    (Substitute "CLASS\_REPO\_PATH" with the path of the upstream class
    repository.)

 4. Push a mirror of the upstream repository to the new, private repository,
    which you have just created:

    ```bash
    $ cd upstream-repo
    $ git push --mirror ssh://git@github.com/USERNAME/PRIVATE_REPO_NAME
    ```

    (Substitute "USERNAME" with your GitHub username and "PRIVATE\_REPO\_NAME"
    with the name of your private repository.)

 5. Remove your clone of the upstream repository.

    ```bash
    $ cd ../
    $ rm -rf upstream-repo
    ```


# Create a Clone of Your Private Repository

This is a one-time process to clone the private repository you have created.

 1. Clone your new, private repository, which is now a mirror of the upstream
    class repository:

    ```bash
    $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/USERNAME/PRIVATE_REPO_NAME
    ```

    (Substitute "USERNAME" with your GitHub username and "PRIVATE\_REPO\_NAME"
    with the name of your private repository.)


 2. Add the upstream repository to your clone:

    ```bash
    $ cd PRIVATE_REPO_NAME
    $ git remote add upstream ssh://git@github.com/CLASS_REPO_PATH
    $ git remote -v
    ```

    (Substitute "PRIVATE\_REPO\_NAME" with the name of your private repository
    and "CLASS\_REPO\_PATH" with the path of the upstream class repository.)


# Create Additional Clones of Your Private Repository (Optional)

If you would like to create additional clones of your private repository on
other machines (e.g., a laptop), follow the instructions for both
[registering SSH keys](#register-an-ssh-key-for-use-with-github) and
[creating a clone](#create-a-clone-of-your-private-repository).
on _that_ machine.  Just remember that you will need to keep all clones
[up-to-date](#update-your-mirrored-repository-from-the-upstream)!


# Update Your Mirrored Repository from the Upstream

Do this every time you would like to pull down the changes from the upstream
repository and integrate them into your own repository.  Remember that you will
need to do this for any and all clones that you have made of your repository.
[that you have made of your repository](#create-a-clone-of-your-private-repository).


 1. Pull down the latest changes from both your repository and the upstream:

    ```bash
    $ git fetch --all
    ```

 2. Stash (save aside) any uncommitted changes that you might have locally in
    your clone:

    ```bash
    $ git stash
    ```

 3. Merge in the changes from the upstream repository:

    ```bash
    $ git merge upstream/master
    ```

 4. Merge back in any uncommitted changes that were stashed:

    ```bash
    $ git stash pop
    ```

 5. Push out the locally merged changes to your repository:

    ```bash
    $ git push
    ```


# Commit and Push Local Changes to Your Private Repo

Do this every time you want to commit changes to the clone of your repository
and push them out to the repository:

 1. Commit any local changes that you've made (i.e., in your own development):

    ```bash
    $ git commit ...
    ```

    (replace "..." with the names of any files or directories that have changes)
 2. Push out your local commits to your repository:

    ```bash
    $ git push
    ```
